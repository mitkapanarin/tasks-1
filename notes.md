*create-new-faculty are saved in faculty base, but its not saving under university

*faculties that I get in browser under uviversity are seen because they are added when I create university, I added them in falulty array in tunderClient------> I fix this, now when i create new faculti in tunderclient under university with given ID, I can get the new faculty in browser too

## packages

* aws-sdk
* multer
multer-s3



* in facyltyRoute add route for get one faculty, so we can use it to get facultyDetails

* FacultyApi------> correct facultyID, universityID?????
